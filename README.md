Praat-Scripts
=============
This repository lists the praat scripts I wrote mostly for the research tasks of Setswana Project, Dept of Linguistics, Georgetown University (PI:Lisa Zsiga,supervisor:One Tlale, funded by National Science Foundation, USA).Also there are some other scripts that are requested by others.

Newer scripts are those written for the CompMusic Project,MTG,UPF(funded by European Research Council).
